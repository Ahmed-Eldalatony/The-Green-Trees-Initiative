# The-Green-Tree-Initiative (non-profit) project template with Asto.jsðŸš€
This is an beautifull template i developed with html, css,js with the help of 
astro.js of organizing and optimizing the project performance. 
The biggest challenge of this project is the layout changing dramaticall on phone, 
but I handled it successfully :).

## Note
Working now on reorganizing the project and making css styles more clean.


Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
    â”œâ”€â”€Imgs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```
