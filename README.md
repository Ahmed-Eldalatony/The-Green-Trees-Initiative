# The-Green-Tree-Initiative (non-profit) project template with Asto.jsðŸš€
This is an beautifull template i developed with html, css,js with the help of 
astro.js of organizing and optimizing the project performance. 
The biggest challenge of this project is the layout changing dramaticall on phone, 
but I handled it successfully :).

## Note
Iam working now on reorganizing the project and making css styles more clean, this why 
you will notice there some unconsitencies among the project.


Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
    â”œâ”€â”€Imgs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
